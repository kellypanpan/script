# From Prompt to Production: How to Use ReadyScriptPro to Shoot Your Short Film

## üé¨ Step 1: Turning Your Idea into a Structured Prompt

Every film starts with a spark ‚Äî an image, a quote, a "what if" scenario. But the key to unlocking AI support is **structuring that spark**. With ReadyScriptPro, you begin by entering a **clear, intentional prompt**, like:

- "A couple argues in IKEA while being watched by security cameras (dramedy, 3 min)"
- "A dog gains the ability to talk for 1 hour ‚Äî only to confess something shocking (dark comedy, 60s)"

Use the prompt form on ReadyScriptPro to define:

- Genre
- Setting
- Number of characters
- Tone (funny, sad, eerie)
- Platform (TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Festival Short)

## ‚úçÔ∏è Step 2: Generating a Cinematic Script with ReadyScriptPro

Once you input your prompt, the platform returns a **shootable script** in seconds:

- Sluglines like `INT. BEDROOM ‚Äì NIGHT`
- Character names, actions, and dialogue
- Embedded direction hints (e.g., "(whispers)", "(beat)")

You can regenerate sections, adjust tone, or export in formats like:

- PDF (shooting format)
- TXT (script only)
- VO-ready script (for narration)

## üé≠ Step 3: Casting and Dialogue Table Reads

Use the exported script to do:

- Quick table reads with friends or actors
- Casting calls for roles
- Script read-through via Zoom or live rehearsal

ReadyScriptPro's formatting helps actors know **where to emphasize**, and scene timing can be reviewed during practice.

## üé• Step 4: Planning Camera Shots from the Script Output

Scripts include basic direction like:

- "Push-in on shocked face"
- "Cut to phone screen ‚Äì 0 unread messages"

You can mark these for:

- Camera moves (pan, zoom, static)
- Scene transitions (cut, dissolve, smash cut)
- VFX inserts or overlays

Tip: Use tools like Shotdeck, Frame.io, or Figma boards to storyboard from AI scripts.

## üéß Step 5: Using Audio Tools to Previsualize Voice and Tone

With Pro tier access, ReadyScriptPro offers **TTS (Text-to-Speech)**:

- Test if jokes land with the right timing
- Hear emotional beats before shooting
- Use voiceovers in rough cuts or as placeholders

Bonus: Use these for **pitch decks**, **brand clients**, or **voice actor auditions**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 6: Location, Props, and Production Setup

Now that you have your script:

- Break down each scene:
  - Where it happens
  - What props are needed
  - What costumes or lighting apply

Example:

**Scene:** "INT. COFFEE SHOP ‚Äì EVENING"  
Needs: Caf√© table, 2 mugs, barista apron, street ambiance audio

Use script structure to build your production schedule and checklist.

## üé¨ Step 7: Shooting and Directing the Film with Script in Hand

Shoot your film by:

- Printing out the ReadyScriptPro script
- Checking off completed scenes
- Reviewing direction notes like:
  - "Pause for laugh beat"
  - "Cut before she answers"
- Following natural dialogue pacing

AI outputs scenes under 1‚Äì3 minutes, perfect for half-day shoots.

## üéûÔ∏è Step 8: Editing with Scene Structure from AI Output

Use your AI script to guide editing:

- Sync scene transitions
- Layer audio cues with beat notes
- Add lower-thirds or captions from dialogue blocks
- Shorten or reorder based on TikTok constraints

Tip: AI scripts help reduce wasted footage and save editor time.

## üì§ Step 9: Distributing Your Short on TikTok & YouTube

Once edited:

- Export vertical format for TikTok / IG Reels
- Use AI-generated logline for caption:
  - "A barista discovers time travelers. 3 minutes that change everything."
- Add tags: #shortfilm #AIfilm #scriptedshort
- Respond to comments ‚Äî offer to generate more via ReadyScriptPro

Optional: Submit to:

- FilmFreeway for micro-shorts
- Short of the Week
- Discord film communities
