> *“I keep filming but nothing sticks. How do I make TikToks that actually hook people?”*  
> — Every creator, ever

TikTok’s `For You` page moves at lightning speed. If your video doesn’t grab attention in the **first 3 seconds**, viewers swipe. Most creators know this—but still stare at a blank page when it’s time to write.

## Why Short-Form Storytelling Needs Structure

1. **Setup** – establish who/where in *one* sentence.  
2. **Conflict / Twist** – the unexpected element that hooks.  
3. **Punchline / CTA** – leave them laughing, shocked, or ready to act.

Without a blueprint, you’ll ramble and lose viewers before they reach the payoff.

4. (Optional) Toggle **Dialog-Only** format for quick teleprompter reading.

### Real Example Output

```markdown

[INT. QUIRKY TIME-TRAVEL CAFÉ – EVENING]

MAYA (checking her watch)  
  He said 7 PM sharp…

ETHAN (appears in a flash of light)  
  Or maybe… I hacked time.
